The Monty Hall problem is a classic game theory problem, where the player has to choose to open one of three closed doors to win a prize.
The host knows which door has the prize behind it, and will choose to open an incorrect door (it cannot be the one the player chose).
The player will then be given the option to either stay with their choice or switch to the other closed door.
Their final decision could be the only thing in their way of winning a grand prize!
Start playing the game to earn one free point, but feel free to use the 'Strategy' option at the cost of one point!
